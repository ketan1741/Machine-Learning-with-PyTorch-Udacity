    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "1. Decision Trees:\n",
    " * Applications : \n",
    "> Fault Diagnosis : Widely used application in the engineering domain is the detection of faults, especially in the identification of a faulty bearing in rotary machineries. This is probably because a bearing is one of the most important components that directly influences the operation of a rotary machine. To detect the existence of a faulty bearing, engineers tend to measure the vibration and acoustic emission (AE) signals emanated from the rotary machine. However, the measurement involves a number of variables, some of which may be less relevant to the investigation. Decision trees are a possible tool to remove such irrelevant variables as they can be used for the purposes of feature selection.\n",
    " * Strengths:\n",
    ">The data pre-processing step for decision trees requires less code and analysis. <br>\n",
    "The data pre-processing step for decision trees requires less time. <br>\n",
    "The concept behind decision tree is more familer to programmers and comparatively easier to understand than other similar algorithms. <br>\n",
    " * Weaknesses:\n",
    ">The reproducibility of decision tree model is highly sensitive as small change in the data can result in large change in the tree structure. <br>\n",
    "The space and time complexity of decision tree model is relatively higher. <br>\n",
    "Decision tree model training time is relatively more as complexity is high. <br>\n",
    "Single Decision tree is often a weak learner so we require a bunch of decision tree for called random forest for better prediction. <br>\n",
    " * As our model consists of multiple features and aim is to classify the income based on the range people earn which is <=50K and >50K.\n",
    "2. Ensemble methods :\n",
    " * Applications : Person recognition is the problem of verifying the identity of a person using characteristics of that person, typically for security applications :\n",
    ">Iris recognition <br>\n",
    ">fingerprint recognition <br>\n",
    ">face recognition <br>\n",
    ">behavior recognition such as speech and handwriting, recognizing characteristics of a person, as opposed to depending upon specific knowledge that the person may have (such as usernames and passwords for computer account access)\n",
    " * Strengths :\n",
    ">Intuitively, ensembles allow the different needs of a difficult problem to be handled by hypotheses suited to those particular needs. <br>\n",
    ">Mathematically, ensembles provide an extra degree of freedom in the classical bias/variance tradeoff, allowing solutions that would be difficult (if not impossible) to reach with only a single hypothesis.\n",
    "They’re unlikely to overfit. <br>\n",
    " * Weaknesses :\n",
    "> The model that is closest to the true data generating process will always be best and will beat most ensemble methods. So if the data come from a linear process, linear models will be much superior to ensemble models. <br>\n",
    "> Ensemble models suffer from lack of interpretability. Sometimes we need predictions and explanations of the predictions. It is hard to convince people to act on predictions when the methods are too complex for their comfort level. Variable importance analysis can help with insights, but if the ensemble is more accurate than a linear additive model, the ensemble is probably exploiting some non-linear and interaction effects that the variable importance analysis can’t completely account for. <br>\n",
    "> Ensemble methods are usually computationally expensive. Therefore, they add learning time and memory constrains to the problem. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    " * Ensemble methods can be used in this project to overcome any overfitting or underfitting occuring in Decision trees.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Support Vector Machines :\n",
    " * Applications :\n",
    "> Bioinformatics – It includes protein classification and cancer classification. We use SVM for identifying the classification of genes, patients on the basis of genes and other biological problems. <br>\n",
    "> Protein fold and remote homology detection – Apply SVM algorithms for protein remote homology detection.\n",
    " * Strengths :\n",
    "> SVM works relatively well when there is clear margin of separation between classes. <br>\n",
    "SVM is more effective in high dimensional spaces. <br>\n",
    "SVM is effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. <br>\n",
    "SVM is relatively memory efficient <br>\n",
    "\n",
    " * Weaknesses:\n",
    "> SVM algorithm is not suitable for large data sets. <br>\n",
    "SVM does not perform very well, when the data set has more noise i.e. target classes are overlapping. <br>\n",
    "In cases where number of features for each data point exceeds the number of training data sample , the SVM will under perform.\n",
    "As the support vector classifier works by putting data points, above and below the classifying hyper plane there is no probabilistic explanation for the classification. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    " * SVM helps to build a better boundaries for classification than logistic regression as the data we have is very large and the number of features we have is also a lot so, SVM can come handy in our project. "

    "* Ada-boost or Adaptive Boosting is one of ensemble boosting classifier proposed by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire in 1996. It combines multiple classifiers to increase the accuracy of classifiers. AdaBoost is an iterative ensemble method. AdaBoost classifier builds a strong classifier by combining multiple poorly performing classifiers so that you will get high accuracy strong classifier. The basic concept behind Adaboost is to set the weights of classifiers and training the data sample in each iteration such that it ensures the accurate predictions of unusual observations. Any machine learning algorithm can be used as base classifier if it accepts weights on the training set. Adaboost should meet two conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The classifier should be trained interactively on various weighed training examples.\n",
    "* In each iteration, it tries to provide an excellent fit for these examples by minimizing training error.\n",
    "\n",
    ">How does the AdaBoost algorithm work?\n",
    "\n",
    "* It works in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initially, Adaboost selects a training subset randomly.\n",
    "2. It iteratively trains the AdaBoost machine learning model by selecting the training set based on the accurate prediction of the last training.\n",
    "3. It assigns the higher weight to wrong classified observations so that in the next iteration these observations will get the high probability for classification.\n",
    "4. Also, It assigns the weight to the trained classifier in each iteration according to the accuracy of the classifier. The more accurate classifier will get high weight.\n",
    "5. This process iterate until the complete training data fits without any error or until reached to the specified maximum number of estimators.\n",
    "6. To classify, perform a \"vote\" across all of the learning algorithms you built.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The most important parameters are base_estimator, n_estimators, and learning_rate.\" (Adaboost Classifier, Chris Albon)\n",
    "\n",
    "> base_estimator: It is a weak learner used to train the model. It uses DecisionTreeClassifier as default weak learner for training purpose. You can also specify different machine learning algorithms. <br>\n",
    "> n_estimators: Number of weak learners to train iteratively.\n",
    "learning_rate: It contributes to the weights of weak learners. It uses 1 as a default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pros\n",
    "* AdaBoost is easy to implement. It iteratively corrects the mistakes of the weak classifier and improves accuracy by combining weak learners. You can use many base classifiers with AdaBoost. AdaBoost is not prone to overfitting. This can be found out via experiment results, but there is no concrete reason available.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
